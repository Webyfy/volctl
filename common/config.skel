# The default setting is for volctl to NOT increase to volume level
# above 100 % but Some users may wish exceed this level. If this describes
# your use case, uncomment the UPPER_THRESHOLD variable below setting it to
# the new upper threshold.

#UPPER_THRESHOLD=150

# increase/decrease volume steps
# by default it is 5%
